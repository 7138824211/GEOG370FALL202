<h3> This map uses the origional data but the categorization is in equal count which better represents the counties with a lower population of citizens holding bachelors degrees.  </h3>

<h3> For this map i had to add data about the population of each county in order to get the percentage of citizens within them that have a bachelors degree. The categorization is in equal count and accurately represents how population plays a factor in how many people hold a degree.  </h3>

<h3> I used the same data from the last map and but this time I categorized the data by natural breaks which disporportionally groups the colors. This map makes it appear that very few citizens in Missouri hold a bachelors degree. Overall this map is the most inaccurate.   </h3>
