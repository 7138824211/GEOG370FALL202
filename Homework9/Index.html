    <h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map </h1>
    <h2>Trinity Brown</h2>
    <h3> My map depicts the average annual snow fall of each state. I chose to make a map of this data because I am currently thinking of where I would like to move after graduation and I know I do not like cold weather. I chose the color green because to me it represents nice weather when the sky is blue and the trees are green!  </h3>
